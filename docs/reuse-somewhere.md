Services on the Web have a fairly convoluted history. The early RPC and SOAP approaches which largely wrapped object-oriented programming constructs in HTTP messages seem incongruous today. The REST architectural style is generally accepted as the most appropriate way of using HTTP. In this view, linked HTML document delivery, the most common use of the Web, is just a specific kind of service.
Most modern data-oriented Web services generally adhere to REST, with payloads from client to server delivered either as HTML form-encoded strings or data structures represented in JSON (Javascript Object Notation) [ref] and the material returned typically again JSON. 
As a practical approach this has much to recommend it. Where it is lacking is in the more general notion of the Web. The data represented in JSON will typically be defined in terms of the application, specific to each and every service endpoint. The Web does facilitate a means of expressing data in a global context, through the use of URLs as identifiers. RDF can provide a global model through which relationships between resources can be expressed.
