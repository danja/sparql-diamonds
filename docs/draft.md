# SPARQL Diamonds : an architectural pattern for rapid development of data-driven applications

# Abstract

This document describes a specific software-architectural pattern as a means of providing solutions to recurring application development demands in the context of the 'Web of Data'. As such a pattern it can be described in the abstract, but it is felt that it has most utility in concrete scenarios involving the Web browser in conjunction with SPARQL servers and the Web at large. 

The infrastructure components of a 'SPARQL Diamond' are a SPARQL server (database, query engine and HTTP server), a Web browser (a HTTP client with processing/rendering capabilities). A text templating engine intermediates custom queries from the user interface and the server endpoint (request). Templating is again applied between the server (response) to deliver appropriate rendering of the results. 

This approach could potentially be used to create content-delivery sites with the same general functionality as typical database-backed systems. However it is felt that it particularly lends itself to rapid prototyping and the enhancement of existing pages with 3rd party information.     

The intention here is to demonstrate that by exploiting widely-deployed systems together with a small number of utility libraries to implement the SPARQL Diamonds pattern, data-driven applications can be created with minimal effort.

# Introduction

// get rid
In May 2001, Scientific American had a feature article entitled "The Semantic Web" [1] written by the inventor of the World Wide Web, a prominent artificial intelligence researcher and an expert in the field of the title. At the time it seemed the publication would have major impact on the direction of subsequent development of the Web. This description of a natural evolution of Web technology had it's roots in Berners-Lees original vision of the Web as a knowledge-sharing environment and by 2001, many of the technical requirements had already been fulfilled (largely coordinated by the W3C [2]). 

The technique has no doubt been used elsewhere before, 

## Operating Environment

The environment of SPARQL Diamonds is shown in Fig. 1. [web-infrastructure.png]. 

This is very similar to a traditional database-backed Web site, the key difference being that instead of the query construction and presentation being carried out server-side, in this context with a SPARQL Server, all that work is carried out at the client. Although the block labelled *Cloud (Server)*  shows typical internal subcomponents, the details of implementation are irrelevant. All that matters is some degree of support for the SPARQL Protocol [https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-protocol/].  

As a Web-based system, SPARQL Diamonds are clearly dependent on the HTTP protocol. More specifically, they are inclined towards the REST [https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm] architectural style. Strictly speaking, SPARQL servers fall outside of this style, notably due to the use of the SPARQL Query Language inside the query part of URLs rather than REST's notion of potentially opaque identifiers that act purely as names for given resources. But in practice this can be viewed as an implementation detail - the combination of endpoint URL with query could be interpreted as merely an arbitrary string identifying a resource, or even aliased from a more human-readable URL.

Client-side, the configuration described here will be that of a typical Web browser. But this doesn't preclude the use of the Diamonds pattern in a different environment such as a dedicated App for a mobile device. The only requirements are a HTTP client, a processing component to manipulate data and control its flow and some means of interacting with the end user.

## Alternative Approaches

The SPARQL Diamond is obviously only one of a multitude of possibilities for interfacing with an online data store. One configuration deserves special mention, that of maintaining an RDF model at client. Several RDF API libraries are available [https://www.w3.org/community/rdfjs/wiki/Comparison_of_RDFJS_libraries]. This approach offers considerable advantages in terms of flexibility, for example with a SPARQL CONSTRUCT request, the resultant RDF can be merged directly into the local model. However this flexibility is typically at the cost of increased programming complexity.  

Another set of solutions are possible by employing a server-side system between the SPARQL server (or other RDF store) and HTTP interface, with the browser being solely for user interface. In fact the 'Diamonds' approach described here originated in an experimental server-side content management system [https://github.com/danja/seki]. After the 'lightbulb moment' of realising the processing could be shifted to the browser, a simple Wiki was built in this fashion [https://github.com/danja/foowiki], with a significant reduction in infrastructure requirements and considerably reduced development and deployment time.

### Pros and Cons

The benefits of this approach largely stem from the decoupling of the query and presentation phases of operations. 

* largely declarative : the data and its presentation are primarily determined by the templates
* relatively fast and lightweight 
* compatible with well-known techniques and standard libraries (eg. jQuery)



* RDF-unaware : the data structure operated on by the client is that of JSON rather than RDF meaning that graph manipulation techniques aren't available 

Most of the time is spent navigating the data
